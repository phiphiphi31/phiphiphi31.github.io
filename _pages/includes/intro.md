I graduated from the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute of Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). I come from Ganzhou in Jiangxi province. 

Last years, I worked with Prof. Chao Ma in SJTU, Prof. [Wankou Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=inPYAuYAAAAJ), Prof. [Kaihua Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=FYatMi8AAAAJ), Prof. [Wangmeng Zuo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=rUOpCEYAAAAJ), Dr. [Chunyu Wang](https://www.chunyuwang.org/), Dr. [Guangting Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cKY8e8sAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), Prof. [Wenjun Zeng](https://www.eitech.edu.cn/?p=leader-Wenjun%20Zeng&tid=19&lang=en), Dr. [Lei Chu](https://lei65537.github.io/), and Dr. [Jiahao Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AcOcw0AAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). I also work closely with Dr. [Zhongdao Wang](https://zhongdao.github.io/).

My research interests focus on computer vision and general AI, including  <font color=Red>visual perception</font> in images and videos. I also have a special interest in <font color=Red>multi-modal large language models</font> (MLLM), <font color=Red>generative AI</font> (AIGC), and the design of <font color=Red>foundation models</font> (Transformer, RNN, and Mamba).

I plan to start my PostDoc research under the supervision of Dr. [Dahua Lin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GMzzRRUAAAAJ&hl=en) in the MMLab in CUHK.
