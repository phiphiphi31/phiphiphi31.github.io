I am a Ph.D. student at the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute of Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. degree supervised by Prof. Chao Ma. I come from Ganzhou in Jiangxi province. 

Last years, I worked with Prof. [Wankou Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=inPYAuYAAAAJ), Prof. [Kaihua Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=FYatMi8AAAAJ), Prof. [Wangmeng Zuo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=rUOpCEYAAAAJ), Dr. [Chunyu Wang](https://www.chunyuwang.org/), Dr. [Guangting Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cKY8e8sAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), Prof. [Wenjun Zeng](https://www.eitech.edu.cn/?p=leader-Wenjun%20Zeng&tid=19&lang=en), Dr. [Lei Chu](https://lei65537.github.io/), and Dr. [Jiahao Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AcOcw0AAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). Currently, I am working with Dr. [Zhongdao Wang](https://zhongdao.github.io/).

My research interests focus on computer vision and general AI, including visual perception in images and videos. I also have a special interest in multi-modal large language models (MLLM), generative AI (AIGC), and the design of foundation models (Transformer, RNNs, and Mamba).

I am expected to graduate in June 2026. If you have any job opportunities available from universities or companies, please contact me.
